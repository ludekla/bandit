## Rusty Bandit

# Introduction

This repo is an exercise in Rust programming. The code implements the 
bandit algorithms laid out in the book

*John Myles White: Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization, O'Reilly 2013*

in one of my favourite programming languages: *Rust* instead of Python (as in the book).

It is always fun to see the performance gain when implementing something in Rust after
having it done in Python.

I came across *bandit theory* when I started reading up on *reinforcement learning*.
Apart from studying bandit algorithms and going through the fun of firing up *cargo* 
and friends once in a while, this was my main motivation.

# Usage

The user may use the code and set up his favourite bandit in the body of main in *main.rs*. 
Of course, the user must know Rust for that purpose to avoid wreaking havoc.
